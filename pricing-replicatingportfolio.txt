## Replicating Portfolio ##

Two important features to understand about options are:

1. they change in value as the underlying changes (delta)
2. the rate at which they change in value changes as the underlying changes (gamma)

One of the basic tenets of option pricing is
that the underlying price is random and unpredictable, but it follows a
process that is modelable and can be characterized statistically
that fact. This fact makes it possible to determine the value of the option
without knowing the actual future price process.

Since marketmakers don't know what if the underlying is going up or down in
the next time increment, they want to position themselves so they are indifferent to
changes in underlying price.

Plotting option price against changing underlying price yields a curved price function like:

![Call price by strike](images/pricing_callpricebystrike.jpg)

This call increase in value without bound as the underlying price increases,
asymptotically approaching a slope of 1. As the underlying goes down, the call price
approaches a slope of 0.

A closer look shows that small increases in stock price result in small
profits in the call value and small decreases in stock price result in small
losses in the call value.

![Call price by strike - zoomed](images/pricing_callpricebystrike-zoomed.jpg)

The marketmakers goal is to trade an offsetting amount of stock to become indifferent to small up/down movements in stock.

To do this, take the derivative of the change in option value with respect to changes in underlying price at the current stock price (i.e. the instantaneous slope of this option value plot, dCallPrice/dUnderlyingPrice). This slope is the option's delta.

![Call delta](images/pricing_calldelta.jpg)

Accumulate the inverse stock position to cancel out the directional bias.

![Call + hedge = locally flat delta](images/pricing_call_hedge.jpg)

The resulting hedged call portfolio displays a convex function with respect
to the underlying price.  This curvature is a result of gamma. Gamma is the
2nd derivative of option price with respective to underlying price,
d2CallPrice/dUnderlyingPrice2 or equivalently, the first derivative of delta
with respect to changes in the underlying). Gamma causes this characteristic
curvature in options payouts, and old-school traders actually refer to the
greek gamma as "curve" (example: "we're short curve, we need to buy some
options"). As a result, owning options (having positive numbers of options
in your portfolio) causes superlinear gains with large movements in underlying behavior.

All options have positive gamma, so if you buy an option, you are always buying gamma (though some options have more gamma than others).

This curvature is important to understanding why options have value, why they are worth more in high volatility regimes, and how the expected rehedging process can tell you how much the option is worth.

## Buying Options: Climbing Out of a Hole ##

![Call price by strike](images/pricing_callpricebystrike1.jpg)

Jill just bought the ACME 100 call, with ACME stock is trading 100, priced on a non-zero volatility, and hopefully it will realize on that same non-zero volatility. How does she capture that with the hedging process?

At purchase time, she immediately hedges her option to look like the risk neutral hedged option above:

![Call + hedge = locally flat delta](images/pricing_call_hedge1.jpg)

Tomorrow morning, she wakes up to find that the underlying stock has moved a
bit. At ACME's new stock price of 99.17 her position has actually increased
in value! (Whew, good thing she hedged by selling stock yesterday!)

![When stock moves, the position makes money](images/pricing_unhedged1a.jpg)

Due to gamma (remember, dDelta/dStock), her position has actually accrued a little bit of delta (directional exposure to the underlying stock) on the ride.  As you can see, further decreases in stock price will increase in our position value (and the reverse, increases in stock price will cause our position value to revert to it's prior place on the curve, losing value).  Since her position does better with decreases in the underlying, the delta value of her portfolio is negative. She is "short delta".

![When stock moves, the position becomes unhedged](images/pricing_unhedged1b.jpg)

She'd like to be indifferent again to changes in underlying price, so she hedges it again like we did before buy buying underlying stock. Owning underlying stock means you will make money as the stock increases, so it is "long delta".  She will buy the appropriate amount of stock to exactly offset her existing short delta position.

![Rehedge again to be delta neutral](images/pricing_rehedge1.jpg)

Whew! OK, no big deal. She bought a little stock at the market price of 99.17 so she's "flat delta" or "delta neutral" again.

Of course, she wakes up tomorrow morning to find that stock has changed
prices again. ACME is trading 98.26.  Again, her position has increased
in value (it rode the curve up to the left). However, she has a negative
bias for the market again. Her position will make money with further down
moves and lose money with upward reversion -- she is short delta.

![When stock moves, the position makes money again!](images/pricing_unhedged2a.jpg)

Following the same pattern of trying to maintain a "delta neutral" portfolio (indifference to directional changes in the underlying), she evaluates the slope of the position at the new stock price, then again buys an offsetting amount of stock, at 98.26

![Rehedge again to be delta neutral](images/pricing_rehedge2.jpg)

The market moves again, as it typically does, and we wake up to a breaking news alert with ACME stock roaring to 101.41!

![When stock moves, the position makes money again!](images/pricing_unhedged3.jpg)

Again, her position value traversed up the curve (this time on the right
side), both increasing her position value and accumulating a directional
preference in the market. This time, it is a positive delta position,
meaning the position has a preference for increases in stock price.  Again,
she evaluates the slope, then trade an offsetting amount of stock. This time
it's a sale of stock at 101.41.

By now you've probably noticed that by hedging her position each time, she
makes money whether the underlying goes up or down.

![Profit either way](images/pricing_alwaysprofit.jpg)

This rehedging process digs us out of the ditch that we got ourselves into
by paying an option premium to acquire the position. Every time we traverse
up one side, our position makes a little of that options premium back.  By
re-hedging the portfolio to be delta neutral, we essentially "lock in" those
gains.

By pivoting the new value plot at the current stock price so that the
slope at the stock price is 0 again, the position essentially ratchets
itself upwards, to recover the options premium outlayed.

----------------------------

__Higher realized volatility, measured in actual changes in the underlying
price, causes bigger swings and we dig out of the hole faster, recovering the
premium we paid.__

__Higher implied volatility, an input for the option price, increases option
price, meaning we have a deeper hole to dig out of, making it harder to
recover the option premium.__

----------------------------

Consider the buyer of an option who continuously rehedges their portfolio to be delta neutral:

* __Implied Volatility at purchase time == Realized Volatility over the life of the option:__
    Buyer breaks even -- the volatility was exactly that predicted, and the position exactly
                         climbs back up to zero profits/losses.

* __Implied Volatility at purchase time < Realized Volatility over the life of the option:__
    Buyer makes money -- the option was transacted at a price assuming a lower volatility,
                         so the higher than expected volatility causes the position to ratchet
                         itself in value beyond the expected amount

* __Implied Volatility at purchase time > Realized Volatility over the life of the option:__
    Buyer loses money -- the underlying didn't move around as much as expected, not giving the
                         hedger enough of a chance to capture the benefits of the option curvature.

---------------------------------

## Selling Options: Walking down a Hill ##

The exact opposite process of the climbing out of a hole above describes the hedging behavior for a short option portfolio.  Rebalancing causes continual value degradation.  This value degradation is a function of the volatility of the underlying.  As you approach a continuous hedging model, the sum of the cash flows will approach the Black-Scholes option price.

## How Does The Replicating Portfolio Make Money? ##

Of course, all these rotating P&L charts don't really rotate, though, you're just creating an aggregated stock+option portfolio that behaves as described.

The call is just a call and it changes in value with the market.

Q: So how is Jill digging herself out of the hole, and where is this money coming from?
A: The stock hedging portfolio.

You should think of this portfolio as being comprised of two parallel
components: one that contains only options, and another that contains only
stock.  In the simple case of a single option being bought, then continually rehedged until expiration:

* the options compoment of the portfolio will consist of one short option for the entire duration, and
* the stock component will have a varying amount of stock that reflects the additive inverse of the option's current sensitivity to changes in underlying price (delta).

As a result, for small changes in underlying price, there's no change in the combined portfolio value. Value changes in the options portfolio cancel those of the stock portfolio.

In the example above, Jill bought the ACME 100 call when ACME was trading 100. That would have had a ~50 delta, so to maintain delta neutrality, her immediate hedge action would have been to sell 50 shares of ACME at 100.00

Over the next 3 hedge actions she:

* bought ACME for  99.17
* bought ACME for  98.26
* sold   ACME at  101.41

if this had continued, she would have:

* bought ACME for  98.86
* bought ACME for  95.79
* sold   ACME at   98.80
* sold   ACME at   99.55
* bought ACME for  99.29
* sold   ACME at  102.07
* bought ACME for  98.21

in various amounts that corresponded to the delta of the option at that
time. At the last transaction, the option would have expired, so she would
have liquidated her portfolio by buying back all her remaining short shares
at 98.21. (A portfolio of just stock has a non-zero delta, the offsetting
stock transaction to reset portfolio to delta exposure to zero is to reverse
the entire stock position.)

You'll notice that this exhibits a pattern of selling high and buying low.  Long option (and therefore positive gamma) portfolios impose that rehedging behavior on the portfolio maintainer, essentially forcing them to create a series of profitable scalping trades.

Higher volatility stocks result in more profitable cashflows from the hedge portfolio, but also tend to have options that are priced on a higher implied volatility, and therefore are more expensive to purchase.

------------------------------------
Footnote

_It's a little bit of a lie to imagine that you paid the premium up front and
are looking to recover it the entire life of the option.  A more accurate
description is that when you buy the option, your unrealized P&L is 0 --
assuming you can sell it at nearly the price you bought it.

Throughtout the life of the option, the vol value will decay away because
time to expiration is decreasing (theta).  So with every step in time, you
start _sinking_ into the hole.  Underlying movement sweeps you back up to
the surface.  If you overpaid for the option (overestimated the future
realized volatility), rate of decay of option value (theta) will overwhelm
the gains from the hedging process (gamma scalping).

Buying and hedging and option is essentially like treading water, hoping
that at each time step the underlying will move enough to offset the
inevitable theta decay.  If the realized vol is less than the implied vol,
you sink (loss). If the realized vol is greater than the implied vol, you float
above the surface (profit)._
