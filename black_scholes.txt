## Understanding Black-Scholes ##

This section requires you to know a little more about options (just what delta is).

The formula for a european call with zero divs and a financing rate of r is:

## C = S * N(d1) - X * e(-rt) * N(d2) ##

My goal is to talk through this so you understand what the formula means.

By definition:

* __N(d1)__ is the delta of the option (dCallPrice/dUnderlyingPrice, or the amount the call will change with a 1 unit move in the underlying)
* __N(d2)__ is the probability that the option ends up in the money
* __S__ is the underlying stock price
* __X__ is the strike price
* __r__ is the risk-free interest rate
* __t__ is the time to expiration, measured in years

A general approach to pricing in finance is to answer the question:

* "_what else can i do to achieve the same results?_" (replication), or
* "_what are the benefits - what are the costs?_" (cashflow equivalency)

We're going to look at value of a Black-Scholes call as the difference
between the benefits and the costs. The difference between what you get and
what you give in an instrument is the value of the instrument.

We know that the benefits will outweight the costs, resulting in a positive
option value.  Vanilla option values can't be negative because you can
always choose to not exercise it, guaranteeing minimum option value of zero.

__C = S N(d1) - X * e(-rt) N(d2)__ is structured as an equality between C, the
value of the call, and the difference between 2 expressions:

* S * N(d1)
* X * e(-rt) * N(d2)

We'll explore each of these in turn.

## What Are The Benefits? ##

You're getting __S * N(d1)__. What does that mean?

What are the benefits of owning a call? __Long calls are long delta__ of the
underlying (you make money as the underlying goes up, you lose money as the
underlying goes down).

__How long is a call?__ $DELTA long.  A call gains value at the rate of it's
delta with respect to changes in the underlying.

Let $DELTA be 0.36. If the underlying goes up 1, you make 36.  A long call
portfolio at this instant will behave as a portfolio of 36 shares of stock
(36 shares moving 1 dollar == 1 call moving 36 dollars).

You can think of the minuend of the BS expression as the value of $DELTA
shares of stock == S * delta == S * N(d1).

## What Is The Cost? ##

The payment implied by the expression is __X * exp(-rt) * N(d2)__.

What is the expected value of the cash outflows?

If the call expires out of the money, we won't exercise it. We won't buy
stock and we won't lay out any cash.

If this call ends up in the money, we'll have to buy for shares of stock.
How much will that cost? It'll cost $STRIKE, the agreed upon amount
specified by the options contract for how much we'll pay for the underlying.
Let's use $STRIKE = 100 as an example.

What is the expected value of this possible future cash outflow? Consider:

* (A) You'll only exercise this call if it's in the money at expiration (you can buy for better than market price)
* (B) If you have to pay $100 at expiration, you'll only need to set aside the present value today of $100.

Today the expected value of this potential stock purchase is the present
value of the strike price (Xe^-rt) multiplied by the probability that this
exercise event will actually occur (N(d2)).

## How Much Is A Call Worth? ##

A call is like long stock. How much stock? $DELTA stock: S * N(d1)

But you have to pay out cash (in expectation). How much cash? "Present value of strike" * "Probability you'll exercise": X(e^-rt) * N(d2)

__C = S * N(d1) - X(e-rt) * N(d2)__
