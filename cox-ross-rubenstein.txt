* Demonstration of CRR.
* Convergence to BS in the limit.
* can be thought of as a simplification of applying a PDF at every time

* American.
* early exercise value. when you should exercise.
* Tree models work with any crazy tree (they just form a terminal price

* Gives you greeks as well.


The first section of pricing, we describe expected value as a way to

As described in the first section on pricing, one approach to options
valuation is the expected value of all possible future outcomes.

CRR is an extension of this idea.

First describe traditional CRR with binomial tree. Then show how this tree
can be generalized to use this approach for essentially any model

CRR outline a binomial tree.  This tree generates the possible terminal
prices.  TAssumptions are constnant volatility.  However, you could
generalize this approach to have different generators of price behavior at
each node.  For simplicity


Price models. Binomial.

Actually, imagine real world prices.  describe as trinomial, with dt=0. at
most timesteps, action is "stay the same".  if you could go back and
characterize this, you'd have a fine trinomial model.  you can even build in
rules like trending or reversion.

at every node, there's just some function F that tells what the next step is
going to be.

this brings you a terminal distribution.

pros/cons.  not closed form. convergence to the real world requires many
steps (200 timesteps==CTC)

Show convergence graph to black scholes

early exercise rules.

show how CRR trees can show you delta, gamma, theta

poor mans vega == run the tree with one vol, run the tree with another vol,
diff the option price results.
