# A Basic Intuition For Option Pricing #

Options novices often just accept that (a) options have value and (b) this
value can be computed by entering required values into a complex formula.
This isn't a particularly meaningful or useful understanding of options
though.

The goal of this chapter is for you to be able to _explain_ to someone else:

* why options have value,
* how someone could compute that value (though not necessarily be able to compute it)
* how to know if an option was overpriced or underpriced

There are a few ways to think about option pricing:

* expected value of the option, computed by the probablity of all possible expiration outcomes and their respective payouts
* value of the continuous hedging process
* cost of creating a portfolio using other financial instruments that
  performs identically to the option

The goal here isn't to teach you how to compute the price of an option, but
rather give you a sense of how to _approach_ options pricing and have you
understand it in a way that you could recreate it at a later date.

The following are just different narratives for the same phenomena. Hopefully one
will resonate for you.
