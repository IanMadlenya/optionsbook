* What are the idealized marketplace assumptions?  No transaction costs,
  normally distributed price returns, constant volatility, european options,
  no financing or carry costs. What happens if you replace those assumptions
  with real world constraints
* Theta
* Refining the ditch climbing and hill descending to include theta -- you're
  really just trying to stay ahead of theta -- more like "treading water"
* variance vs volatility -- linear accrual (why we hedge often)
* Implied Volatility vs Realized volatility. Define.
* Order flow -- are options cheap or expensive? if paper is net buyers, why
  isn't vol expensive? is it? BXM? Is there a trading strategy here by
  selling options?
* Put Call Parity
* Options in practice -- out of the moneys are traded
* Synthetics
* Option inputs -- how does changing them affect pnl plots and greeks
* Greeks -- how does changing them affect pnl plots and greeks
* Tim's charts of option prices, greeks with changes in vol, time, strike, rates
* Spreads
* Other Underlying models (totally random, jump diffusion). How do they
  affect option prices?
* When should you early exercise an option?
* Vol skews -- didn't exist pre 1987. why do they make sense? order flow, vol slider
* Call skew (commodities) vs put skew (equities) vs currency skews
* Hedging models -- impact on pricing. real world considerations:
  transaction costs and crossing spread
* Vol surface
* Why Black Scholes is good enough, even though it's wrong (why we don't care about model risk)
* Model risk -- 2 way flow destroys that
* Path dependency -- how you get screwed even when you're right about realized vol
* Using flies to figure out the underlying's terminal price distributions
* Weirdly annoying real world things, like clearing houses, financing, multi group, and how that affects both pricing and real world trading
* OCC  -- you don't actually transact with the ACTUAL seller, you don't know who that is
* Early exercise games: boxes, deep spread dividend plays, open interest plays
* Selling CME deeps to collect interest (exploiting clearing house trust/inefficiency)
* Bonus: arb and commodity months:fghjkmnquvxz

# Side Note: Usage Gripe #

"Long" and "short" are adjectives describing the sign (negative or positive)
of a position.

It is common to use "short" as a verb also, as in "I shorted ABC"/"I'm going to short ABC", or as an adjective "I got short ABC"/"I am short ABC".

"Long" however is generally used as an adjective only, as in "I got long ABC"/"I am long ABC". It is infrequent among traders to hear "long" used as a verb, as in "I longed ABC" or "you should long ABC"

* I shorted ABC -- ok
* I'm going to short ABC  -- ok
* I got short ABC -- ok
* I am short ABC -- ok
* I'm long ABC -- ok
* I got long ABC -- ok
* I longed ABC -- weird, don't say it
* I'm going to long ABC -- this is weird, don't say it
* You should Long ABC -- this is weird, don't say it

However, in most cases, for a verb, just say I bought ABC or I sold ABC, unless you are specifically indicating that you put on a negative position.
